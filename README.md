# itc102-extra-credit
I started out this quarter as a student wanting to learn more about technology and the technological world, and i find that this
class has taught me exactly that. Anything we've gone over from gaming, to programming, and my personal favorite hardware has 
taught me the fundementals of what i want to go into specifically. The most memorable time i took out of this class was when
Tarah physically opened up a computer to show the class what is inside and what each piece does. I found this to be insanely
interesting and fun. I used to look at the technological world as something that was very boring and based around the fact that 
people wanted to make a lot of money. However after taking this course i can now see the genuine interest that can be found
with technology. If i was to go into the field of technology i would venture into hardware design because of the knowledge that
was passed onto me in this class. I am very pleased with how this quarter went and cannot wait to take another technology class
in the future.
